# Backup-inator

Behold! My Backup-inator!

Anyways, basically it backs up to a server that runs `backup_server.py`.

# Disclaimer

This only works with Linux and Windows (Hopefully) with no plans to make it work on MacOS (Because I do not have money for Apple Products)

This is tested with Windows as the client OS and Linux as the server OS so yeah there's that
